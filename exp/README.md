# Experiment for 3.5
## Data Preparation
Since the CiCLoDS is written in Python, so we need to first extract the data from the R library.
1. Run data_generation.R
2. Run run_ciclods_exp.py (it will write gene selected and allocations)
3. Run BayesCafe.R, BayesSpace.R
4. Run BayesSpace_w_CiCLoDS_init.R (or you can use data we already generated from data dir)
